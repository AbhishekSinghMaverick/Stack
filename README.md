| 1     | Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1. | [NextGreaterElement.cpp](https://github.com/AbhishekSinghMaverick/Stack/blob/master/NextGreaterElement.cpp) |[Problem Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-larger-element/0)|
| 2     | Given an integer array of size N. For each element in the array, check whether there exist a smaller element on the next immediate position of the array. If such an element exists, print that element. If there is no smaller element on the immediate next to the element then print -1. | [ImmediateSmallerElement.cpp](https://github.com/AbhishekSinghMaverick/Stack/blob/master/ImmediateSmallerElement.cpp) |[Problem Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/immediate-smaller-element/0)|
